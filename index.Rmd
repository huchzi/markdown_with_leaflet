## Map

This documents shows a map with seven coordinates on three continents. A secret society of mathematicians may or may not have hidden clues leading to a treasure there...

```{r map}
fibs <- c(13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233)
prime <- c(13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37)

data.frame(lat = prime, lng = fibs) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers()
```
